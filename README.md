<u><b>SOURCE DATA:</b></u>

Data for this assignment were downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was originally obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

<u><b>SUBMISSION:</b></u>

The final submission includes the following files:
<ul>
    README.md
    CodeBook.md - a brief description of the data and transformation steps, with some details of the variables included in the final dataset. 
    run_analysis.R - R script containg the code to complete the steps in the assignment
    secondTidyDataset.txt - final tidy data set produced in step 5, as described in Assignment Instructions below.
</ul>

<u><b>ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS:</b></u>

Create one R script called "run_analysis.R" that does the following:
<ul>
    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
</ul>
The output from step 5 in the above instructions is included as the file "secondTidyDataSet.txt".
